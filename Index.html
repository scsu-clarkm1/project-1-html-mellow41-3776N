                   <p>Crawfish are a small freshwater crustacean. Like their larger cousins, the lobster, they have a relatively small amount of meat in a larger shell.</p> 
                   <p>Most crawfish are harvested between December and June, but March, April, and May are the peak months in Louisiana.</p> 
                   <p>Southern Louisiana produces over 80 million pounds of crawfish each year, most raised in shallow man-made ponds and harvested commercially.</p> 
                   <p>Crawfish can also be harvested wild, as they live in swamps, bayous, and ditches.</p> 
                    <p>Wild crawfish are often called â€œmudbugs.</p> 
                    <p>because they burrow into the water-logged coastal soil over the winter to keep warm.</p>

                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Fill turkey fryer half full with water. Turn it on and wait for it to boil</li>
                        <li>Add crawfish boil seasoning (to taste) to boiling water. 
                            For a moderately spicy batch, we used close to half of the 4.5 lb jar of crawfish boil seasoning. 
                            Add potatoes and carrots to the pot, cook for 10 min.</li>
                        <li>Add corn on the cob, cook for another 5 minutes</li>
                        <li>Add live crawfish and cook for 15 minutes (if all the crawfish don't fit in the pot, 
                            cook them in two batches, using the same broth.)</li>
                        <li>When the crawfish are done, take the strainer basket out and dump the crawfish into the clean cooler to keep them warm. 
                            Many times, local Cajun cooks dump the cooked crawfish onto a newspaper covered table, ready to eat.</li>
                        <li>Peel and Enjoy.</li><br>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If nobody is talking, then the food must be GOOD&#33;</p><br>
